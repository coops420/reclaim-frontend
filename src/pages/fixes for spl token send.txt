🎉 What Made It Work?
Your SPL token transfer finally worked because we fixed three key issues that were breaking the transaction.

✅ 1. Explicitly Setting the recentBlockhash Before Signing
🔴 What Was Wrong?
The transaction was missing a recent blockhash, causing "Transaction recentBlockhash required" errors.
Solana requires a fresh blockhash for every transaction, but it wasn’t always being set before signing.
✅ How We Fixed It:
We explicitly fetched the latest blockhash before signing and set it in the transaction:
javascript
Copy
Edit
const latestBlockhash = await connection.getLatestBlockhash("finalized");
transaction.recentBlockhash = latestBlockhash.blockhash;
We ensured a fresh blockhash was set before sending the transaction.
✅ 2. Creating the Recipient’s Associated Token Account (If Missing)
🔴 What Was Wrong?
SPL tokens require an associated token account to receive tokens.
If the recipient didn’t have a $CLAIM token account, the transaction failed before sending.
Solana doesn’t create token accounts automatically, unlike native SOL transfers.
✅ How We Fixed It:
We checked if the recipient already had a token account:
javascript
Copy
Edit
try {
  await getAccount(connection, receiverTokenAccount);
} catch (err) {
  console.log("Creating recipient's associated token account...");
If the recipient didn’t have an account, we created one before sending the $CLAIM:
javascript
Copy
Edit
const createAccountTransaction = new Transaction().add(
  createAssociatedTokenAccountInstruction(
    walletAddress,
    receiverTokenAccount,
    RECIPIENT_WALLET,
    CLAIM_TOKEN_MINT
  )
);

createAccountTransaction.recentBlockhash = latestBlockhash.blockhash;
createAccountTransaction.feePayer = walletAddress;

console.log("Requesting Phantom confirmation to create recipient token account...");
await window.solana.signAndSendTransaction(createAccountTransaction);
console.log("Recipient's token account created.");
This ensured the recipient had a valid SPL token account before sending tokens.
✅ 3. Using signAndSendTransaction() Instead of sendTransaction()
🔴 What Was Wrong?
We were originally using sendTransaction(), which doesn't work well for SPL token transfers.
Unlike SOL transfers, SPL token transfers require explicit signing before sending.
sendTransaction() automatically signs and submits, skipping the necessary step of allowing Phantom Wallet to confirm the transfer.
✅ How We Fixed It:
We switched to signAndSendTransaction(), which forces Phantom Wallet to confirm before sending:
javascript
Copy
Edit
const { signature } = await window.solana.signAndSendTransaction(transaction);
Why This Works:
✅ Signs the transaction manually before sending.
✅ Ensures Phantom Wallet prompts for confirmation.
✅ Allows for better debugging of errors before the transaction is sent.
🎯 Future Tips: How to Avoid These Issues Again
1️⃣ 🔹 Always Fetch a Fresh Blockhash Before Signing

Every transaction needs a new blockhash to prevent expiration errors.
Always fetch it with:
javascript
Copy
Edit
const latestBlockhash = await connection.getLatestBlockhash("finalized");
transaction.recentBlockhash = latestBlockhash.blockhash;
2️⃣ 🔹 Always Check If the Recipient Has a Token Account Before Sending SPL Tokens

Use:
javascript
Copy
Edit
await getAccount(connection, receiverTokenAccount);
If they don’t have an account, create one first before sending tokens.
3️⃣ 🔹 Use signAndSendTransaction() for SPL Token Transfers

Always use signAndSendTransaction() instead of sendTransaction() when transferring SPL tokens.
This ensures Phantom Wallet confirms the transaction before sending.

handleBuyNow calls ensureWalletConnected() from your snippet to connect Phantom if needed.
Fetches blockhash → checks for token accounts → if missing, creates the recipient’s token account → does the SPL token transfer with signAndSendTransaction().
